# 🐱✨ NyanFly: Girly Edition

A girly, Flappy Bird-style game made with Python, inspired by Nyan Cat and built for my daughter. Tap to fly, dodge stuff, and vibe out to the chaos.

## 🎮 How It Works

You control a flying cat (or a yellow block with eyes!) by pressing the spacebar to flap and avoid crashing into pipes. The game speeds up and tracks your score — it's simple, chaotic, and fun.
